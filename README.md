Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One driver has kept
track of several tankfuls of gasoline by recording kilometers driven and liters used for each tankful. Develop
a Python program that prompts the user to input the kilometers driven and liters used for each tankful.
The program should calculate and display the kilometers per liters obtained for each tankful. After
processing all input information, the program should calculate and print the combined kilometers per liters
obtained for all tankful (= total kilometers driven divide by total liters used).
